# TODO-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
"I successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive 'To-Do Management System' project using Java, 
Spring Boot framework, and MySQL database. The project integrated various essential technologies, 
including Spring Security for robust user authentication and authorization, JPA and Hibernate for efficient data persistence, ModelMapper for object mapping, 
and advanced exception handling to ensure system reliability. Leveraging Spring MVC and REST APIs, I developed a seamless user interface for adding, updating, 
deleting, and retrieving tasks, making it a user-friendly and responsive application. Additionally, I employed the Maven build tool for project management and Lombok for streamlined code development.

This role-based application showcases my ability to architect and develop complex systems, effectively utilizing modern technologies and best practices in software development."
